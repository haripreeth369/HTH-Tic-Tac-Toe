# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe, or "Noughts and Crosses," is a two-player game on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty squares with "X" or "O," aiming to align three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or all squares are filled, resulting in a draw.
